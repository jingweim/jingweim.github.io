## About me
I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at the [UW Graphics and Imaging Laboratory (GRAIL)](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) working with Prof. [Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/), Prof. [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/) and Prof. [Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/). Previously, I studied computer science at MIT and had the honor to work with Prof. [Antonio Torralba](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/torralbalab/) and Prof. [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/).

My current research interests are 3D Reconstruction and Neural Rendering. My ongoing and past projects involve Neural Rendering, Image Forensics, Image Synthesis, and 3D Reconstruction.
